                        the course schedule into the system. This is, according to doing some testing,
                        about 95% of all courses.

                        A correcltly inserted course schedule, that will work with this app, looks
                        something like the example below in the UTA study schedule. The lectures, tutorials
                        and whatever the course includes, are listed under the heading "Teaching".

                    <p className="help-section-text">
                        The calendar is correct in cases where the course teacher has inserted the schedule correctly.
                        This app gets all the information it has through the UTA open data API, which is updated daily.
                        That is the same information that is displayed in the official teaching schedules.

                        of the validity of the information.

                        No. But you can download as many subsequent courses as you wish, and import them separately to your calendar.
                        This is in many ways much more convenient.

                        For example, you can download the lectures before the course starts. Then, when you get to know
                        your (possible) exercise group, you can download that and add it to your calendar.

                        There are many calendar apps to choose from, google instructions if you need help. I
                        recommend Google Calendar myself, as it's easy to use both on mobile and in a browser
                        and works really well.

                    <p className="help-section-text">
                        Within the app of your choice, I would advise you to create a separate calendar
                        for each separate course. Then you can neatly color code and filter different courses
                        so you can easily make sense of your complete calendar.
