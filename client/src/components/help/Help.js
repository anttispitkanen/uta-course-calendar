                        exercises or other lessons are then parsed to an .ics-file (ICAL,
                        standard calendar format), that can be imported to basically any
                        electronic calendar.

                        This works with any course where the course teacher has correctly inserted
                        the course schedule into the system. This is, according to doing some testing,
                        about 95% of all courses.

                        A correcltly inserted course schedule, that will work with this app, looks
                        something like the example below in the UTA study schedule. The lectures, tutorials
                        and whatever the course includes, are listed under the heading "Teaching".

                        There are also cases where the teacher has not inserted the information correctly.
                        In such case this app cannot create the calendar.

                        The calendar is correct in cases where the course teacher has inserted the schedule correctly.

                        However, I can't promise that the teachers or the API

                    <p className="help-section-text">
                        For example, you can download the lectures before the course starts. Then, when you get to know
                        your (possible) exercise group, you can download that.

                        However, within the app of your choice, I would advise you to create a separate calendar
                        for each separate course. Then you can neatly color code different courses so you can
                        easily make sense of your complete calendar.
